# Logistic Regression Project ðŸ¤–ðŸ“Š

This project demonstrates the use of **Logistic Regression** to predict customer purchase behavior based on two features: **Age** and **Salary**.

## Purpose ðŸŽ¯

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that classifies whether a customer will purchase a product or not, based on their age and salary data. Logistic Regression is used here because it is a straightforward and effective classification algorithm for binary outcomes (Yes/No).

## Whatâ€™s Inside ðŸ“¦

- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical data  
- Splitting data into training and test sets  
- Training a Logistic Regression model  
- Evaluating the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix  
- Making predictions on new data points  
- Visualizing the results with scatter plots and confusion matrix
